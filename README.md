Below are some projects I have worked on:

# Class Projects

## STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science:
## **[Card Pack Price Webscraping and Simulation](Group_7_Final_Paper.html)**
 - I worked in a group with 4 other students to webscrape the market prices of Yugioh cards, clean this price data and join it to a dataset of card characteristics, analyze which factors contributed most to card price, and simulate the most cost effective way to purchase all cards in a set.

## STOR 565: Machine Learning:
## **[Machine Learning Zillow Price Prediction](STOR_565_Final_Paper.pdf)**
 - I worked in a group with 3 other students to train a variety of machine learning models on housing data, then apply the most effective model
to predict prices of similar houses on Zillow from key features and present the results.

## LING 460: Textual Analysis With R:
## **[Mixed Model Sentiment Analysis](LING_460_Final_Paper.pdf)**
 - I worked in a group with 3 other students to create a mixed effects model to predict hotel review scores from the words present in reviews while
accounting for random variation due to the hotel for which the review was placed. We then constructed confidence intervals for the model coefficients
to determine whether there was a significant difference in review score for commonly used words dependent upon whether the word was present in the
positive or negative section of the review.

# Professional Projects

##  **[Replace Names and Values:](https://github.com/Jackson-Adams/Jackson-Adams.github.io/blob/main/Replace%20Names%20and%20Values.Rmd)**
 - I created a script in R to replace sensitive information in a csv file. Names are replaced with a sample of webscraped popular names, with options to replace first names, last names, or both. Numbers are replaced with similar values, with numeric values from the Normal distribution, and integer values from the Poisson distribution with a mean of the original value.

##  **[Uncle's Family Kitchen Order Sheet:](Uncle's%20Family%20Kitchen%20Order%20Sheet.html)**
 - I received a commission to create an Excel Spreadsheet for the small business **[Uncle's Family Kitchen](https://www.unclesfamilykitchen.com/)** which would summarize the number of pizza orders from the website Square in a format that could be easily printed.

## Outlook Contact Import csv Creation: 
 - While working as a Resident Advisor in my junior year, I found there was no efficient way to create Outlook contact lists from emails in the school's housing database. I created a script in R to produce csv files for each floor in a set of residence halls, which could then be imported as contacts by the RAs of each floor.
