## Projects

 
Below are some projects I have worked on through or outside of my classes:

# Outlook Contact Import csv Creation: 
While working as a Resident Advisor in my junior year, I found there was no efficient way to create Outlook contact lists from emails in the school's housing database. I created a script in R to produce csv files for each floor in a set of residence halls, which could then be imported as contacts by the RAs of each floor.

# Uncle's Pizza Excel Summary: 
I received a commission to create an Excel Spreadsheet for the small business Uncle's Pizza which would summarize the number of pizza
orders from the website Square in a format that could be easily printed.

#  **[Replace Names and Values:](https://github.com/Jackson-Adams/Jackson-Adams.github.io/blob/main/Replace%20Names%20and%20Values.Rmd)**

I created a script in R to replace sensitive information in a csv file. Names are replaced with a sample of webscraped popular names, with options to replace first names, last names, or both. Numbers are replaced with similar values, with numeric values from the Normal distribution, and integer values from the Poisson distribution with a mean of the original value.
